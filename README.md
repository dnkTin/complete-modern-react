This app is for cloning a Twitter app.

** Note 1 **
The application is setup to connect to a local PostgreSQL database but you can change this in the app-data-source.ts file. The Docker connection settings can be found in the Docker section if you need them. Don't forget that you need to have your PostgreSQL database setup and running before you can connect to it.
